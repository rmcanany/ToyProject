 Getting started with collaboration.

## Getting Set Up

GitHub has compiled a 
[**Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart). 
That's probably the best place to start.  I worked through all the sections. 
It took a couple of days.

Note, the second section is about setting up Git. FYI, I use 
[**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/).  I followed this guide to 
[**Install and Configure**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop) it.
To get up to speed on Git, which is very helpful, take a look at this
[**Book**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/).
It's comprehensive and free!

## Collaborating

Once you're set up with GitHub, try the following.  Don't worry, you won't break
anything that can't be fixed.  That's the great thing about Git and GitHub.

<ol>
    <li>
        Clone the project and create a new branch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make some changes and commit them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Merge your new branch into main.  Delete the old branch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a pull request.
    </li>
    <li>
        I will merge your pull request.  Not only that, I'll even add your name to 
the Contributors list!
    </li>
</ol>
