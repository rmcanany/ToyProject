## DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge Housekeeper is designed to help you find annoying little errors in your project.  It can identify failed features in 3D models, detached dimensions in drawings, missing parts in assemblies, and more.  It can also update certain individual file settings to match those in a template you specify.
