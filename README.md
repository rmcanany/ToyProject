# ToyProject
 Getting started with collaboration.

## Getting Set Up

GitHub has compiled a 
[**Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart). 
That's probably the best place to start.  I worked through all the sections. 
It took a couple of days.

Note, the second section is about setting up Git. FYI, I use 
[**GitHub Desktop**](https://desktop.github.com/).  I followed this guide to 
[**Install and Configure**](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop) it.

## Collaborating

Once you're set up with GitHub, try the following.  Don't worry, you won't break
anything that can't be fixed.  That's the great thing about Git and GitHub.

<ol>
    <li>
        Fork the project on GitHub.  This copies the repo to your account.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clone the repo to your local machine.  You can do this in GitHub Desktop.
Click the Current repository dropdown, click Add, then click Clone repository...
    </li>
    <li>
        Still in GitHub Desktop, create a new branch.
    </li>
    <li>
        In Visual Studio, make some changes in Module1.vb and test.
    </li>
    <li>
        Back in GitHub Desktop, commit the changes.  Then push the changes back up to your 
GitHub fork.
    </li>
    <li>
        On GitHub, create a pull request.
    </li>
    <li>
        I will merge your pull request.  Not only that, I'll even add your name to 
the Contributors list!
    </li>
    <li>
        Once you're notified of the merge, log back on GitHub and click Sync fork.
    </li>
</ol>

## Learn more about Git

Once you get the basics of collaborating, 
you might want to get a better understanding of Git.
For that, take a look at this free online
[**Book**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/).
