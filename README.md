# ToyProject
 Getting started with collaboration

## Getting Set Up

GitHub has compiled a 
[**Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart)

Note, the second section is about setting up Git. FYI, I use GitHub Desktop.

## Collaborating

Once you're set up with GitHub, try the following.  Don't worry, you won't break
anything that can't be fixed.  That's the great thing about Git and GitHub.

<ol>
    <li>
        Clone the project and create a new branch.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make some changes and commit them.
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a pull request.
    </li>
    <li>
        I will merge the pull request (if I can figure it out).
    </li>
</ol>
